COURSE OUTLINE and LEARNING HOURS \\n  \\nCourse Outline and Tentative Module Dates \\nCLOs \\nContact/ \\nLearnin\\ng Hours \\nModule 0: Introduction (June 6 and 10) \\nCourse Overview and Welcome, Course Materials, Meet Your Coach and \\nCommunity, Roles, Rules, and Routines, Guidelines for Discussions (and Other \\nTasks), Introductions \\n \\nModule 0 is made to touch base with students. This will include small, \\nungraded activities to indicate the class’s overall knowledge of art. It will \\nalso serve to ease the students into preliminary terms, concepts, and \\nframeworks that will recur throughout the course. \\nJune 6: Introductory session \\n1, 3 \\n7,5/10 \\nJune 10: Key readings: Lazzari/Schlesier, “A human phenomenon”. \\nGombrich, “On art and artists” \\nJune 10: AAG visit \\nWatch: Philosophy Tube: Is Art Meaningless? \\nhttps://youtu.be/T6EOVCYx7mY?si=cgYZYyRwqAk_0xmO \\nModule 1: Encountering Art (June 13 and 17) \\nWhat is art? How do I know when something in front of me is art and not just \\nsome object? Is there something about that object? Or is it art because it’s \\nbeautiful or it moves me? It’s in a museum—it’s got to be art, right?  \\nThe introductory module uses the instance of interaction with art as its \\nmain material, investigating its underlying questions and assumptions. The \\nmodule opens the discussion of art by framing the aesthetic experience as \\nsomething already part of the everyday, and allowing that experience to \\nstand as foundation for the appreciation of art. The trajectory of this \\nappreciation would then include introductions to frameworks (e.g. form-\\nfunction-content, art-artist-audience), languages of art (native, colonial, \\ncontemporary, technological) and other manners by which the creative \\npractice has been theorized.  \\nKey texts: D’Alleva, “Analysis of Form, Symbol, and Sign”; Taylor, “Analysis \\nof the Work of Art” or Guillermo, “Reading the Image”; Sontag, “Against \\nInterpretation” \\nGraded essay: analysis of a work of art  \\n1, 2 \\n7.5/15 \\nModule 2: Art and Reality (June 20 and 24)  \\nHow many different ways can you paint a bowl of fruit? Can’t you just \\nphotograph it? If I need to need to know something about a car, what will a \\npainting of it realistically achieve? Why bother seeing the Spolarium in the \\nNational Museum when I can see it in a book or with Google image search? \\nWhy aren’t things like they are in movies? Why is my life like a movie?  \\nThis module tackles the multiple interactions between art and reality. The \\ntopics range from the early conceptions of art as imitation, the creation of \\nrepresentations, the changes brought about by mechanical reproduction, all \\nup to the process of artistic creation as also creation of realities, simulations, \\nand even fabrications. The module can also tackle notions of creativity in the \\nsense of artistic journeys—learning via imitating styles, sources, and \\ninspirations. Even art as expression is seen as a variant of art trying to \\ncreate/recreate reality.  \\nKey text: Benjamin, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical \\nReproduction” \\nViewing: Berger, Ways of Seeing E.1 \\n \\nGroup project: art podcast  \\n1, 2 \\n7.5/15 \\nModule 3: Art and Value (June 27 and July 1) \\nWhy are the paintings in the malls cheaper than the ones in the gallery? Who \\ncares if this is pop, rock, or pop rock? I’m really into it, though, does that make \\nme hipster? Why is watching ballet more “cultured” than watching a rom-\\ncom?  \\n3, 4 \\n7.5/15 \\nThis module focuses on the multiple relationships between art and its \\nvalues. The topics range from the conceptions and promises of style, the \\nneed for categorization, the divides between high art and low art, the \\ncreation of taste, up to its contextualization in cultures. Also included in this \\nmodule would be an introduction to the different art ecologies and \\ninstitutions, their creations and productions, essentially clarifying how \\nvalue is mediated between these shifting parts.  \\nKey text: Geczy, “Money”, Berger, “Ways of Seeing”; Reyes, “Desire and \\nFantasy”; Dickie, “A Tale of two Artworlds” \\nViewing: \\nBoyson, Oscar (director), “The Art Market (in Four \\nParts” Artsy. U.S.: UPS and Artsy, 3 May 2017. [Video / Youtube] \\nGroup Project: presentation “A case for…” \\nModule 4: Art and Identity (July 4 and 8) \\nWhy is there an entire library for women’s writings? Is it Filipino because the \\nartist is Filipino, or because it depicts life in the Philippines? What is this \\nsaying about the artist? What is this saying about me? \\nThe fourth module focuses on the uninterrupted connection between art \\nand identity. Here the discussion primarily focuses on the human aspect of \\nart, whether as artist or audience, and how these art interactions formulate \\nand at the same time modify existing notions of identity. Although all of \\nthese will have already been foregrounded throughout the whole course, \\nthis module aims to make it the central question. The topics here also \\ninclude the weight of factors such as race, gender, ethnicity, identification, \\nculture, and even autobiography as challenging pre-existing assumptions \\nabout the connection between the human and art.  \\n- Key Texts: Nochlin, “Why have there been no great women artists?”; \\nPilcher, “Introduction to A Queer Little History of Art”; Arndt, Wasak! ; \\nRobertson, “Identity” \\nIndividual project: creative project \\n1, 2 \\n7.5/15 \\nModule 5: presentation and synthesis (July 11 and 15)  \\nThis module focuses on the teacher giving direct feedback to the students. \\nAll the students’ submissions will be discussed in class to lend them stakes \\nthat so characterize existing art. Module 5 is especially crucial since Module \\n4 concludes with a creative work of art. Students’ output forms the module’s \\ntext. \\n1, 2 \\n7.5/14 \\nFinals Week (July 17-20) Deadline synthesis paper: July 17 \\n3 \\n0/6 \\n \\nTOTAL \\n45/90 \\n \\nE.

The Art Podcast allots a space for \\nstudents to conduct discussions within their own small \\ngroups, focusing on a particular art area, event, or location \\nand supplementing the analysis with references and insights \\nfrom the class lectures. The advantage of the podcast is that \\nit is not a speech—there is no need to pre-package and \\nmechanize usual arguments. The nature of talking is \\nexploratory.  \\nIn their discussion, the group is expected to apply the \\ntheories discussed in Module 2 to a specific art exhibit, \\nperformance, show, etc. that they have experienced. \\n \\n[ Content (60%) | Framework (20%) | Technical (20%)]  \\nModule 3: “A Case For” \\n \\nIn this activity, students arranged into groups are asked to \\nmake a case for (or against) a certain artist, work of art, or \\nmovement that is valued, or dominant art-world practices \\nthat are instrumental to valuating art. For instance, one \\ncould argue for or against award-giving bodies as credible \\nmeasurements of art’s value.

CLASS POLICIES \\n \\n1. Official Class Learning Management System (LMS) and Other Software \\nCanvas will serve as the University’s official learning management system, including this class. Please \\nmake sure you are registered for the appropriate course in your LMS profile. Synchronous sessions are \\nheld onsite unless assigned to be online (as scheduled in the syllabus) or unless announced otherwise. \\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Grades on the LMS do not necessarily reflect actual grades. Final grades will be \\nposted on AISIS. \\n \\n2. Accessibility of Academic Materials and Student Services \\nFor most of your technical and virtual needs, especially concerning internet access, you may contact LS \\nONE (https://sites.google.com/ateneo.edu/ls-one). You may also contact the ITRMO \\n(itrmo@ateneo.edu) for LMS-specific issues. For students who will encounter situations that will \\nprevent them from accessing lectures, modules, and other class materials through regular modes, \\nrequests for low-bandwidth or offline versions may be communicated privately to the instructor so that \\nthey can make necessary arrangements ahead of time. \\nThe Loyola Schools Office of Guidance and Counseling (LSOGC) offers programs and services for \\nstudents who have mental health concerns or are in need of counseling. You may reach the LSOGC at \\nguidance.ls@ateneo.edu or through their Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LSOGC. \\n \\n3. Class Attendance and Synchronous Sessions \\n“Regular attendance in all classes is one of the most important obligations of students” therefore, \\nstudents are expected to attend and fully participate in all class activities and sessions, both onsite and \\nonline synchronous, so that they enjoy the full benefits of learning. \\nStudents have a maximum of 2 absences for the entire semester. Tardy students, during onsite classes \\nand consultations, will merit a half-cut. \\nIn accordance with the 28 July 2023 memo from the OAVP-UEd, we shall return to the standard \\nregulations on Attendance stipulated in the LS Undergraduate Academic Regulations Section III. As \\nhighlighted in the memo, “We are resuming the implementation of Academic Regulation III.4.1 that \\nstates: ‘There is no distinction between excused and unexcused absences.’” Further, the Academic \\nRegulations also stipulate that “Class hours lost by late registration are considered as absences.” \\n“Students are held responsible for all matters taken and assignments given in their absence.” Students \\nwill receive an automatic grade of W (Withdraw) if they exceed the number of allowed absences which \\nis equivalent to a 0 and is included in their QPI. \\n4. Communication and Consultations \\nAll official communication should be coursed either through the LMS or University-issued email \\naddresses. Students should use their OBF accounts for this purpose. Please do not contact teachers via \\nsocial-media messaging and other personal means regarding course-related concerns unless otherwise \\nspecified. As with the Canvas registration (or any official LMS or online tool that will be used within the \\nLoyola Schools), only students with OBF accounts shall be granted access to such and all platforms. In \\ncase you have issues with your OBF email address, please contact the Office of Management Information \\nSystems at omis.ls@ateneo.edu. \\nQuestions and concerns raised in Canvas or other official platforms can expect an answer 2 days of the \\nmodule\\'s release. Students may email the teacher for more immediate concerns, and can expect a \\nresponse within 2 days during the work week.  \\nIndividual or group consultations are available during class hours - assuming that there are no \\nsynchronous sessions scheduled or similar activity at the time. Students may request a consultation \\nwithin the day of their class schedule and expect a quick and positive response. \\nConsultations beyond class hours should be scheduled at least 2 days in advance, and wait for a \\nconfirmation from the teacher. Last-minute consultation requests, especially ones scheduled at the end \\nof the week will also require an email request and confirmation from the teacher. Unapproved requests \\nwill be rescheduled to the next available time. \\n \\n5. Submissions, Deadlines, and Online Exams \\nIdeally, no requirements shall be accepted if not submitted through Canvas. If for some reason you are \\nhaving problems with these channels, inform the instructor as soon as possible. Tasks of the course are \\ndesigned to be formative and are best done in the order prescribed by the modules. These tasks must be \\ncompleted on time and meet deadlines. Late submissions receive a penalty of 5% per day. \\nThe deadlines for course requirements have been planned in order to give students the most time \\npossible to complete them safely without compromising learning, but are negotiable on an individual or \\na classwide basis should compelling safety and accessibility concerns arise. Please alert the instructor \\nimmediately with regard to these. \\nShould a student miss a major synchronous exam (20%), a formal request to take said exam, addressed \\nto faculty and chair and with the reason stated, must be sent through email. \\nAn INC (Incomplete) may only be given to students in extraordinary circumstances, meriting \\nconsideration by the instructor. The highest possible grade of any and all major requirements \\nsubmitted after the posting of the grades that do not classify under this category will be a C+.  \\nStudents are expected to reach out to their instructor upon receiving the INC to coordinate new \\ndeadlines. Failure to submit may result in one of two scenarios, at the discretion of the instructor: \\n• \\nA final grade of F for class regardless of the student’s current standing. \\n• \\nThe existing submissions of the student for the class are graded according to their \\nassigned weights. \\nSimilarly, a student can get a grade of W if the highest possible total % weight of requirements fulfilled \\nis less than 33.33% by the end of the semester. If the highest possible total % weight of the \\nrequirements fulfilled is greater than or equal to 33.33% by the end of the semester, the appropriate \\nletter grade shall be issued. Final grades are then computed on the basis of 100% of course \\nrequirements as indicated in the syllabus. \\nTo avoid missing out on deadlines and other requirements, it is recommended that you set your \\nnotification preferences on the Notifications tab under your Canvas account page. \\n6. Privacy, Intellectual Property Rights, and Confidentiality. \\nThe online environment gives rise to increasing concerns about privacy and confidentiality, and it is \\nimperative that we all take the extra effort to protect our own work and those of our peers. In light of \\nthis, let us commit to the rule that what happens in the class’s spaces stays in the class’s spaces. \\nThis means you are not allowed to share or repost any of the class content posted in the LMS or \\nother class-designated spaces (e.g. the class Google Drive created by your instructor) on any other \\nonline platforms without your instructor’s express written permission as well as the express written \\npermission of any and all parties who have contributed to the content. Such content includes, both \\nthrough copy-pasted text and through screenshots or screen recordings: the text of the LMS pages, \\nposts by your instructor and/or peers in the discussion boards, and your peers’ uploaded \\nassessments/assignments. \\n \\nPlagiarism will not be tolerated. Students caught plagiarizing on any requirement, major or minor, \\nwill be dealt with according to the official LS policies on academic dishonesty. Practicing personal \\ndiscipline and professional behavior is still expected even in online classes. \\n \\n7. Class Conduct and Decorum \\nThe classroom, whatever form it may take, is a venue where both students and teachers can learn from \\neach other. Behavior which prevents or disrupts this process of learning is unacceptable, and all \\nbehaviors which would be considered such in an offline setting continue to be such in an online setting.  \\n \\n8. Gender Inclusion and Safe Spaces \\nWe are committed to maintaining the same safe, inclusive, and gender-responsive learning \\nenvironment online as we hope to foster offline. To that end, we commit to teaching and learning \\npractices that promote gender equality and justice (e.g., the use of non-sexist language and avoidance of \\ngender stereotypes and biases in our learning spaces), as well as to implementing policies that protect \\nstudents and faculty alike from sexual and gender- based violence, discrimination, and harassment, in \\nline with the provisions of the LS Gender Policy and the Code of Decorum and Administrative rules on \\nSexual Harassment.    \\n \\nHELPFUL RESOURCES: \\n• \\nOne-Stop Shop LS Helpdesk \\n• \\nAteneo Blue Cloud Primer \\n• \\nTips for Online Learning \\n• \\nRizal Library Online Resources \\n• \\nLS Code of Academic Integrity \\n• \\nLS Gender Policy \\nCode of Decorum and Administrative Rules on Sexual Harassment, Other Forms of Sexual \\nMisconduct, and Inappropriate Behavior \\n \\nL.

COURSE DESCRIPTION \\nThis course introduces first year students to faith and spirituality as integral, intelligible dimensions of \\nhuman life that are essential to the pursuit of wholeness in one’s self and in the world today. This study  is \\nundertaken through the lens of a particular community, the Catholic Church, and focuses on Christianity’s \\ncentral figure, Jesus, as presented in the Bible, other normative texts, and contemporary practices, in \\ndialogue with other worldviews such as those of postmodernity, atheism, agnosticism, and secular \\nhumanism. A major component of the course is the students’ articulation and analysis of their own faith-\\nnarratives that highlight the journey of transformation among people of faith and faith’s personal-yet-\\necclesial dimensions. \\nCOURSE NUMBER\\nTheo 11\\nNO.

CLASS POLICIES \\nStudents taking this fully-onsite course and on the Ateneo  Blue Cloud need to be self-directed learners.  \\nBeing in charge of your own learning  involves a level of responsibility that you and your teacher  will help \\ndevelop    if you are to transition well into college. Below are some guidelines and class policies that will help \\nyou succeed: \\n1.\\nCreate a Schedule \\na.\\nThis face to face, onsite class is offered during a semester, supported by an online learning \\ninfrastructure. \\nb. \\tYou are expected to create a schedule that works for you AND that keeps pace with the \\nrecommended deadlines and time frame that your teacher has set for the course. \\n■\\nWe will have twenty two onsite classes as scheduled here: \\no For Sections A2, B2 and D2 January 15, 18, 22, 29; February 1, 8, 15, 19, 22, 26; March \\n4, 7, 11, 18, 21; April 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 25, 29. \\no\\nOur seven online classes are on: February 12, 29; March 14; April 11, 18; May \\n2 & 6. \\n\\t\\n \\n■\\nStudents who are late by ten minutes will be considered absent. Coming to class after \\nthe opening prayer and before the 10-minute grace period is considered late. \\nLateness of three times is considered one absence. The allowed number of absences \\nis six.

These may include eating or drinking within the laboratory, improper use \\nof equipment, and violating laboratory rules. \\n \\n \\n \\nRUBRICS: (for Essay Conceptual Questions in all assessments) \\n \\nExcellent (A):  The laboratory report is very clear, complete, organized, and well developed.  The \\nreport displays a solid conceptual understanding of physics concepts, and articulates the \\nrelationships between physical parameters that are relevant to answering the discussion questions.  \\nThe language is accurate and precise.  All tables and figures are high quality images, and are \\nproperly labeled.  Calculations are complete and clear especially the step-by-step propagation of \\nerrors/uncertainties if required.  All final answers are given in the correct number of significant \\nfigures and in the appropriate SI units.  \\nAverage (B/B+):  The laboratory report is generally clear, focused and displays some development \\nof ideas that is necessary to fully discuss the relevant physics concepts.   In general, the language \\nis accurate and precise.  While the ideas still need further development, the report is able to clearly \\ncommunicate the important concepts.  In general, tables and figures are properly labeled, but the \\nquality of the images could be further improved.  The calculations are generally clear.  Final answers \\nare displayed with the appropriate units and with the correct number of significant figures. \\n \\nFair (C/C+):  The laboratory report is somewhat focused, and the conceptual responses need \\ndevelopment.  However, the laboratory report still correctly interprets physics concepts relevant to \\nthe discussion questions.  The language may be somewhat inaccurate, and may occasionally have \\nsome grammatical errors but the laboratory report is still able to communicate the essential ideas \\nand concepts.  Tables and figures are not consistently labeled completely, and as such, they may \\nnot serve to guide the reader into a clearer understanding of the main results.  The calculations and \\nfinal answers are not always given with the appropriate units and correct number of significant \\nfigures.  \\nDeveloping Competence (D):  The laboratory report is rambling, unclear, and scientific ideas are \\nunderdeveloped.  Tables and figures are haphazardly prepared, and therefore, do not clearly \\nconvey the results.  The report may also lack relevant required calculations, or answers to required \\ndiscussion questions.  \\n \\nInadequate (F):  Failure to submit the laboratory report results to a grade of F. \\n \\n \\n \\nF.

The official learning management system for this course will be Canvas. \\n2. Only students who are officially enrolled will be included in the Canvas class. \\n3. Only students who are officially enrolled will be allowed to take assessments. \\n4. Students who require support for Canvas may seek help by sending an email to \\nls.one@ateneo.edu or chatting with LS-One through that account using their obf email. \\n5. Student access to the Canvas course will be closed a week after the electronic release of grades \\nfor the second semester. Students are encouraged to download the course materials as well as \\nthe records of their grades before the Canvas course closes.  \\n6. Grades reflected on Canvas are not necessarily the official grades for the class. \\n7. Students with no or very unstable internet connection are advised to immediately inform (by email \\nor through a phone call) (a) their Chair/ Program Director, (b) ls.one@ateneo.edu, and (c) me so \\nthat the appropriate assistance can be extended and adjustments can be made. If necessary, \\nportable learning packets which can be in the form of flash drives or printed materials can be sent \\nto the students. \\n8. It would be nice if students’ cameras are kept open during synchronous sessions so that I can \\nsee who I am talking to and receive non-verbal feedback. But keeping cameras open is not \\nrequired. \\n9. The total number of absences in a class must not exceed 20% of the total number of meetings \\n(sum of PHYSICAL class meetings and ONLINE synchronous sessions). Following this rule, the \\nmaximum number of allowed absences in this class is three (3) only. Absence will be entailed if a \\nstudent fails to attend the class 30 minutes after the start of the class. \\n10. Students will receive an automatic grade of W (Withdrawal without Permission) if their absences \\nexceed three (3). \\n11. In consideration of the continued volatility of the situation owing to the pandemic, excused \\nabsences are not counted towards the maximum number of allowed absences. An absence due \\nto internet connectivity issues may be excused, provided that supporting documents (i.e. \\nscreenshots of “internet connectivity status” with the appropriate date and time stamp) were \\nsubmitted directly to me for evaluation.  \\n12. A recording of synchronous sessions will be uploaded in the class Google Drive at least a day \\nafter the synchronous session. The class beadle and co-beadle should remind me to record the \\nsession and upload the session in the class Google Drive (or if Zoom allows it, for them to (ask \\nme to make them co-hosts so that they can) record the session themselves) \\n13. Students may communicate with me using the message function in Canvas or using my email \\naddress found below. You may send your messages anytime but expect a reply during office \\nhours. \\n14. Feedback on a submitted output will be given within a week after submission. \\n15. As a student, regular attendance in all meetings is one of your most important obligations. \\nFurthermore, you need to accomplish modular activities and participate in discussion forums in a \\nspecific week and submit the required deliverables at a specific date. \\n16. No make-up laboratory session. Missed onsite experiment due to unexcused absence in the lab \\nclass will automatically mean a zero score in the corresponding worksheet/report.  \\n17. Worksheets/reports are due a week after the actual experiment and must be submitted to the \\nclass beadle at the start of an onsite lab session. Any worksheet/report not submitted during the \\nclass time will be considered one day late. Policy on late submission of worksheets/reports: 1 \\npoint deduction per day. \\n18. For safety reasons, please wear long pants and closed shoes during onsite laboratory sessions.  \\n19. Place all bags under the laboratory table. \\n20. Always bring your scientific calculator. Mobile phones and other gadgets cannot be used as a \\nsubstitute for calculators. \\n21. Under no circumstances shall make-up projects or extra work be given to compensate for your \\ngrades due to lack of effort exerted during the term. \\n22. Academic integrity plays a vital role in the learning that takes place in this subject, and \\nsubmitting work as your own that was generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is plagiarism. \\nHence, any work written, developed, or created by generative AI does not lend itself to our \\nlearning goals and is a breach of ethical engagement and the University’s academic integrity \\npolicy.  \\n23. Academic dishonesty (cheating, forgery, plagiarism, etc.) is a serious offense in the academic \\ndiscipline. Based on LS Student Handbook, cheating in any major course requirement (those that \\nconstitute 20% or more of the final grade in the course) will merit an academic penalty of F in the \\ncourse and will be regarded as a major disciplinary offense. On the other hand, cheating in any \\nother course requirement will merit a minimum academic penalty of F in that academic \\nrequirement, and will be subjected to the usual review befitting a disciplinary case. \\n24. Ateneo de Manila University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, marital or \\nparental status, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. See the following link for \\nmore information on the LS Gender Policy: http://www.ateneo.edu/ls/ls-gender-policy. \\n25. The code of decorum and administrative rules on sexual harassment, other forms of sexual \\nmisconduct, and inappropriate behavior is found in this link: \\nhttps://www.ateneo.edu/policies/code-decorum-investigation-sexual-harassment.   \\n26. If there are any current or emergent circumstances that make online learning difficult for you, I \\nwould appreciate it if you inform me right away.  \\n27. Students are encouraged to use the chat function at any time during the synchronous session \\n(and not just when I ask if there are questions). This gives me a sense of what you are thinking \\nand what your reactions are. In a face-to-face situation, teachers prefer students (to recite but) \\nnot to chat in class but in an online environment, chat is preferred. Students are also encouraged \\nto reply to each other’s chat messages. \\n \\n \\nOn Safety: \\nIn some experiments, your own safety and that of your fellow students will depend on you. It is \\nexpected that common sense will be used in the laboratory and that any dangerous procedures are \\nto be performed only AFTER gaining a full understanding of the experiment. (Students are expected \\nto review all laboratory handouts and procedures prior to the experiment proper.)  Your instructor is \\nthere to assist you in this regard. Some standard rules are the following: \\n• \\nNo smoking. \\n• \\nNo eating, drinking or chewing of gum within the laboratory. \\n• \\nAny breakage and/or malfunction of the equipment are to be reported to the instructor as soon \\nas it happens. \\n• \\nNo running around, jumping, pushing and other forms of unnecessary actions. \\nJ.

The student’s \\nresponse shows a solid conceptual understanding of physics concepts and can articulate the \\nrelationships between physical parameters that are relevant to answering the conceptual \\nquestion.  The language is accurate and precise, and the examples discussed clearly reflect the \\nrelevant physics concepts.  \\n \\nAverage (B / 85%):  The essay is generally clear, focused, and displays some development of \\nideas that is necessary to discuss the relevant physics concepts.  In general, the language is \\naccurate and precise. While the ideas still need further development, the essay can clearly \\ncommunicate the important concepts.     \\n \\nFair (C / 70%):  The essay is somewhat focused, and the conceptual response needs \\ndevelopment. However, the essay still correctly interprets physics concepts relevant to the \\nproblem.    The language may be somewhat inaccurate and may occasionally have some \\ngrammatical errors but the essay is still able to communicate the essential ideas and concepts.   \\n \\nDeveloping Competence (D / 50%): The essay has at least one correct interpretation of physics \\nconcepts needed to address the conceptual question.  However, the relationships between \\nphysical parameters are not fully understood, and therefore, not clearly articulated.  The \\nlanguage may be somewhat inaccurate and may interfere with the reader’s ability to fully \\nunderstand the ideas being conveyed.   \\n \\nInadequate (F / 20%): The essay does not show any conceptual understanding of physics \\nconcepts. It is rambling, unclear, and scientific ideas are underdeveloped.  The examples \\ndiscussed are unrelated or irrelevant to the conceptual question. \\n \\nRubrics: Class Presentations \\n \\n  \\nContent \\n(50 points) \\nCreativity \\n(25 points) \\nNovelty \\n(25 points) \\n90 – \\n100% \\nThe physics concepts \\nneeded to explain the \\ntopic are complete and \\nreported properly. \\nSources that are used \\nare properly cited not just \\nin the references section \\nbut during the report as \\nwell. \\nColorful visuals and/or \\nanimations that not only \\nserve aesthetically but \\naids in the content as \\nwell. Only important \\ntexts are displayed in \\nthe report and the \\ndetails are explained \\nproperly by the \\nreporter. The reporter is \\nvery enthusiastic and \\ncaptures the attention \\nof the audience. \\nThe topic chosen and the \\nphysics behind the report \\nare modern and/or \\nunprecedented but are \\nalso very interesting to the \\ntarget audience which is a \\ngroup of non-physics \\nmajor students. \\n75 – \\n89% \\nSome physics concepts \\nare missing but are \\notherwise adequate to \\npresent the report. \\nSources are cited and \\nplaced in the references \\nsection. \\nGood visuals and/or \\nanimation also aid the \\nreporting of the content. \\nMore texts are \\ndisplayed but other \\ndetails are otherwise \\nbeing explained by the \\nreporter. The reporter is \\nenthusiastic but there \\nare some lulls in the \\nreport. \\nThe topic chosen is fairly \\nnew but quite common but \\nstill piques the interests of \\nthe audience. \\n60 – \\n74% \\nMost physics concepts \\nare missing, and some \\nthat are present are \\nincorrect when \\nexplaining the report. \\nMost of the sources are \\ncited properly. \\nVery basic visuals and \\nanimations. A lot of \\ntexts are displayed, and \\nthe reporter mostly \\nreads off from the \\npresentation. The \\nreporter is not as \\nenthusiastic and is \\nThe topic chosen is \\nalready very common but \\nmay still be of interest to \\nthe audience. \\nmonotonous when \\nspeaking. \\n50 – \\n59% \\nMost physics concepts \\nare either missing or \\nincorrect and only a few \\ncan correctly explain the \\ntopics in the report. Only \\na few sources are \\nproperly cited. \\nVery little to no visuals \\nand/or animations. The \\nreport is purely \\ncomposed of texts that \\nthe reporter just reads \\nfrom. The reporter does \\nnot display any \\nenthusiasm toward the \\nreport and is not \\ninterested in capturing \\nthe interest of the \\naudience. \\nThe topic and physics \\nbehind are very common \\nand most people are \\nalready familiar with them, \\nespecially the target \\naudience, and they may \\nnot be as interested in \\nlistening. \\n \\n \\nRubrics: For Problem Solving Assessments \\n \\nExcellent (5 pts): The solution includes the necessary parts such as the given variables, the \\nmissing variable being asked, the equation needed to solve the missing variable, the step-by-\\nstep process towards getting the final answer, and the final answer. The solution is clear and is \\nthe correct solution to arrive at the final answer. The final answer is encircled or boxed. \\n \\nAverage (4 pts): The solution is missing some parts in the step-by-step process but is still \\ncomplete and can be easily followed. The solution and final answer are still correct and fairly \\ncomplete. The final answer is correct and is boxed and encircled. \\n \\nFair (3 pts): The solution is missing critical parts such as the given variables and/or the needed \\nequation but the step-by-step process is still complete and sound. Some steps leading to the \\nfinal answer may have been skipped but it is otherwise understood as to how the answer arrived. \\nThe final answer is correct and is boxed and encircled. \\n \\nDeveloping Competence (2 pts): The solution is missing most parts but can still be followed. \\nThe needed equation is correctly used but the solution may be somewhat inaccurate and is \\nmissing some critical steps. The final answer may be incomplete or incorrect due to some small \\nerrors, but the solution is still fairly sound. \\n \\nInadequate (0-1 pt): The solution and final answer are both incorrect, incoherent, and are not \\nclose to the actual solution needed to get the answer. \\n \\n \\nF.

Only students who are officially enrolled will be included in the Canvas class. \\n3. Only students who are officially enrolled will be allowed to take assessments. \\n4. Students who require support for Canvas may seek help by sending an email to \\nls.one@ateneo.edu or chatting with LS-One through that account using their obf email. \\n5. Student access to the Canvas course will be closed a week after the electronic release of \\ngrades for the first quarter. Students are encouraged to download the course materials as \\nwell as the records of their grades before the Canvas course closes. \\n6. Grades reflected on Canvas are not necessarily the official grades for the class. \\n7. Students with no or very unstable internet connection are advised to immediately inform \\n(by email or through a phone call) (a) their Chair/ Program Director, (b) \\nls.one@ateneo.edu, and (c) me so that the appropriate assistance can be extended, and \\nadjustments can be made. If necessary, portable learning packets which can be in the \\nform of flash drives or printed materials can be sent to the students. \\n8. Classes are primarily onsite unless otherwise announced at least a day beforehand due to \\nemergency or unforeseen circumstances. \\n9. Keeping cameras open during a synchronous session is not required especially if there \\nare connectivity issues but it is highly recommended to keep them open so that I may see \\nyou during these sessions. \\n10. For online and flex classes: A recording of synchronous sessions will be uploaded to the \\nclass Google Drive at least a day after the synchronous session. The class beadle and co-\\nbeadle should remind me to record the session and upload the session in the class \\nGoogle Drive (or if Zoom allows it, for them to ask me to make them co-hosts so that they \\ncan record the session themselves) \\n11. Students are only allowed six (6) total absences whether online or onsite. If a student \\nexceeds this number of absences, he/she will automatically receive a grade of W. For \\nvalid reasons, a make-up long exam/quiz will be given for the missed exam during an \\nabsence. \\n12. Students may communicate with me using my email address found below or using the \\nmessage function in Canvas which I prefer. You may send in your messages anytime and \\nexpect a reply within 1 to 2 days. \\n13. Always bring your scientific calculator. No borrowing and/or lending of calculators, \\nespecially during exams. Mobile phones and other gadgets cannot be used as a substitute \\nfor calculators. \\n14. Under no circumstances shall make-up projects or extra work be given to compensate for \\nyour grades due to lack of performance during the semester. The course requirements \\nalready provide ample opportunity for students to get good grades. Bonus activities will be \\ngiven solely under the discretion of the teacher and a student cannot request this. \\n15. Academic dishonesty (cheating, forgery, plagiarism, etc.) is a serious offense in the \\nacademic discipline. Based on LS Student Handbook, cheating in any major course \\nrequirement (those that constitute 20% or more of the final grade in the course) will merit \\nan academic penalty of F in the course and will be regarded as a major disciplinary \\noffense. On the other hand, cheating in any other course requirement will merit a minimum \\nacademic penalty of F in that academic requirement, and will be subjected to the usual \\nreview befitting a disciplinary case. \\n \\nM.

COURSE DESCRIPTION \\n \\nPower boxing is a modern physical fitness activity that many people are getting into nowadays.  It is real \\nboxing training without the risk of injuries caused by sparring.  Power boxing makes use of shadow \\nboxing training and focus mitt  training, which covers all the fundamentals of boxing, which are:  \\npunching; slipping, bobbing and weaving; blocking, parrying, and covering; and footwork.  Currently, \\nmany enthusiasts avail of this type of training in many of the fitness gyms all over the country, since what \\nmost people want is to get the benefits of training in boxing (physical fitness and self-defense) without \\nreally having to spar or compete in the ring.  Although the course is designed for students who are \\nassumed to have zero or near zero skill in boxing, students with prior boxing training also benefit from \\nthe class by having their technique refined and enhanced.

Class participation refers to the level of engagement/impact of participation during \\nthe entire semester: Quality of tasks performance and overall execution of the required course activities, \\ncompliance with the course requirements and delivery of tasks on time, and attending the class in official \\nLS PE uniform. Point deductions will be given to incomplete task performance, tardiness, late submission \\nand/or presentation of the required assignments or activities, and not wearing the official LS PE uniform \\nduring PE time.         \\n9. In lieu of class participation, the teacher reserves the right and option to assign students either of the \\nfollowing: \\na. missed required task performance \\nb. alternative activity/project \\nThese are applicable only on the basis of submitting proper documents confirmed by designated \\nAteneo offices (e.g., OHS, OGC). \\n10. Class Beadle. A class beadle will be assigned to assist the teacher in disseminating information or making \\nannouncements in the Canvas inbox. The class beadle is also expected to assist the teacher in guiding \\nstudents pertinent to the given tasks. \\n11. Communication. Students are encouraged to communicate with their teacher for feedback and concerns \\nbefore resorting to alternative means. For privacy and security reasons, only the official Ateneo accounts \\n(obf.ateneo.edu) of students will be recognized. This applies to Canvas inbox, emails and asynchronous \\nsessions. Likewise, teachers will only use their official Ateneo account (ateneo.edu). Students are \\nexpected to be responsible in fulfilling the requirements and meeting deadlines. In case a student \\nencounters a reasonable issue or concern, the student must inform the teacher BEFORE the \\ndeadline/assessment schedule. \\n12. Academic Integrity. It is the responsibility of every student to know the standards of conduct and \\nexpectations of academic integrity that apply to each undertaking. Academic dishonesty will not be \\ntolerated and will result in the maximum penalty as defined in the Student Handbook. Below are \\nexamples of academic dishonesty: \\n• Cheating during exams, \\n• Copying another student’s work including assignments and reports, \\n• Receiving assistance from anyone else with quizzes or assignments, \\n• Fabrication of data, and \\n• Plagiarism. \\n13. Academic Conduct. Students are expected to treat their peers and teachers with respect at all times even \\nin an online environment. Committing any form of discourtesy or misbehavior may lead to disciplinary \\naction. Academic policies can be found in LS-One (20210129 ADAA_ADGP Memo Academic Policies) \\n14. LS Gender Policy. Ateneo de Manila University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, marital \\nor parental status, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. See the following link for more \\ninformation on the LS Gender Policy: www.ateneo.edu/ls/ls-gender-policy. \\n \\nK.2  Additional Policies and Reminders \\n1. Address teacher as Sir or Coach. \\n2.

COURSE DESCRIPTION \\n \\nMATH 10 is a course that exposes the students to various aspects of human life in which mathematics \\nis used as a tool for analysis, decision-making, and design creation.  \\nThe course begins with an introduction to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in \\nnature and the environment) and as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By exploring \\nthese topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical understanding of mathematics as merely \\na bunch of formulas but as a source of aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language \\nin itself (and of science) governed by logic and reasoning. \\n \\nThe course then proceeds to survey ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding \\nand dealing with various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making \\nsocial choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data transmission and \\nsecurity, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will provide opportunities for actually doing \\nmathematics in a broad range of exercises that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a \\nway of knowing, and test the students’ understanding and capacity. \\nWHERE IS THE COURSE SITUATED WITHIN THE FORMATION STAGES  \\nIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LOYOLA SCHOOLS CURRICULA \\n✔ \\nFOUNDATIONS: Exploring and Equipping the Self \\n \\nROOTEDNESS: Investigating and Knowing the World \\n \\nDEEPENING: Defining the Self in the World \\n \\nLEADERSHIP: Engaging and Transforming the World \\n \\nMATH 10 Course Syllabus \\n \\n2023–2024 First Semester \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\n \\nC.

CLASS POLICIES \\n \\n1. Learning Platform. This course will be conducted primarily through onsite sessions with the \\nmaterials accessible through the Ateneo Canvas platform, with some online sessions to be held via \\nZoom. The student’s Canvas account should bear the student’s full name. The student’s recent \\npicture should be used as profile photo. Thus, students will need to have good enough Internet \\nconnection to participate according to the original intent of the course. However, students who may \\nhave limited or no internet connection may request for a portable learning packet (PLP) through LS \\nOne (www.ateneo.edu/lsone).  \\n \\n2. Course Materials. All materials in the course modules and recordings of online sessions should not \\nbe posted in any social media platform nor shared with individuals who are not enrolled in the class. \\nInfringements may result in disciplinary actions. \\n \\n3. Course Announcements and Other Communications. The instructor will communicate with the \\nstudents via announcements on Canvas or via their OBF e-mails. Students are expected to check \\nCanvas and their OBF accounts regularly. Students who wish to contact the teacher should do so \\nonly through email or Canvas. Students should refrain from sending emails outside office hours \\n(Mon-Fri, 8:00am – 5:00pm).   \\n \\n4. Textbook. Students are encouraged to have a copy of the textbook as a reference for lectures and \\npractice exercises. You may buy a copy either from the LS bookstore or direct from the publisher. \\n \\n5. Computing Tools. Students may have a standard scientific calculator at their disposal for this \\ncourse. Students will also benefit from the use MS Excel in some modules. \\n \\n6. On-site and Online Synchronous Sessions. The entire course will be mostly synchronous onsite \\nsessions. Online synchronous sessions, if any, will be held via Zoom and will be recorded. The \\nrecordings will be made available to the class. For days without a synchronous session, students \\nare expected to accomplish tasks even without meeting the teacher. See tentative calendar below. \\n \\n7. Attendance. Attendance will be checked. The maximum number of absences allowed is six (6). A \\nstudent who exceeds this number will automatically get a W (Withdrawal) for this course.  \\n \\n8. Graded Assessments. Long tests, quizzes, group activities will be administered ONSITE, and will \\nbe timed.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPenalties (e.g. a zero in that graded requirement) will be imposed on submissions that are \\neither completed after the deadline or are not compliant to the guidelines set by the \\nteacher. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nShould there be any mistake in the checking of any graded requirement, a student has two \\ndays after the said requirement is returned to report the oversight to the teacher. . Any late \\nrequests will not be entertained. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFailure to submit at least one major requirement will entail a grade of INC.    \\n \\n8. Makeup Assessments. A make-up long test or quiz will be given only if the student has a valid \\nreason for missing it. To procure approval, the student must write a letter of request to the teacher \\nwithin two days after the missed assessment. This should include the reason for missing the long \\ntest. Other supporting documents (if any) may be emailed with the letter. Makeup long tests will be \\nonsite, and is usually more challenging than the regular long test.  \\n   \\nMATH 10 Course Syllabus \\n \\n2023–2024 First Semester \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n9. Course Grades. Grades computed by the Canvas platform are not official. Students should keep a \\nrecord of their scores and know how to compute for their grades as indicated in this syllabus. The \\nofficial grade of the student in the course is the grade that is posted by the Registrar and reflected \\nin the student’s AISIS account. \\n \\n10. Consultations. Onsite and online consultations with the teacher are to be scheduled only during \\nofficial consultation hours. Requests for consultation outside class hours are subject to the approval \\nof the teacher. In an online consultation, there should be at least three people (including the \\nteacher) in the meeting room. In this instance, the third person in the meeting room cannot be a \\nrelative of the student.   \\n \\n11. Academic Integrity. Students are expected to exercise the highest level of academic integrity. \\nCheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be treated as a grave offense. Disciplinary \\naction will be pursued, following the process set by the university. Cheating during any graded \\nactivity includes, but is not limited to, posting of answers or hints related to any graded work in any \\nonline (e.g. social networking sites, chats) or offline (e.g. text messages) platform.   \\n \\n \\n12. Academic Conduct and the Loyola Schools (LS) Gender Policy. Students are expected to treat \\ntheir peers and teacher with respect at all times even in an online environment. Committing any \\nform of discourtesy or misbehavior may lead to disciplinary action. In addition, Ateneo de Manila \\nUniversity does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, marital or parental status, sexual \\norientation, or gender identity or expression.  \\n \\n13. Provisions to Convert to a Fully Online Class. If, due to unforeseen events (e.g. health \\nemergency) this course is converted to a fully online class, then all affected onsite sessions will \\nautomatically be online synchronous sessions held via Zoom. Attendance will still be monitored \\nbased on the Reports setting in Zoom. Moreover, all affected assessments will be taken online. The \\nMath Department Proctoring Protocol for Fully Online Students will be strictly implemented. \\n \\n14. Covid-19 Exposure Protocol. Students who are symptomatic or tested positive for COVID 19 \\nshould report the information directly to the Office of Health Services for verification (email : \\nhealthservices.ls@ateneo.edu; contact numbers 09189445997 or local 5110). In addition, notify \\nyour instructor if you are symptomatic, tested positive for COVID 19, or have been identified as a \\nclose contact of someone who tested positive for COVID 19.  \\n \\n \\nL.

CLASS POLICIES \\nEXPECTATIONS  \\nWe must come to some agreement regarding what we may expect from each other.  \\n1. We are using Canvas, the official Ateneo online learning management system.  You need to be \\nresponsible for your Canvas accounts.  This means activating your Ateneo @obf.ateneo.edu \\naccounts to be able to access it, regularly checking your email and Canvas accounts for online \\nlearning, announcements, and assignments, and alerting me in a timely fashion for any technical \\ndifficulties.   \\n2. This course will cover an estimated 90 learning hours, which include time for asynchronous \\nindependent work. We will hold onsite and online synchronous classes and for online \\nsynchronous classes, I will send the Zoom link on Canvas.  You are responsible for getting your \\nZoom accounts working. During online synchronous sessions please keep your cameras open \\nso that I can see who I am talking to and receive non-verbal feedback in order to enhance class \\ninteraction. In cases when you have connectivity issues, these sessions will be recorded and \\navailable to everyone.  A recording of the synchronous sessions will be uploaded on the \\nAnnouncement page on Canvas or the Class Google Drive at least a day after the session for \\nthose who cannot attend. Should there be some technical difficulties, please inform me right \\naway via email at mcmontenegro@ateneo.edu  \\n3. Students are expected to attend and fully participate in these sessions, and you are expected to \\nmake every effort to be punctual. Although a limited number of absences is allowed, the total \\nnumber of absences in a class must not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total number of \\nmeetings per academic term. Section III attendance regulations of the Undergraduate Student \\nHandbook, 2023 edition gives details of the maximum number of allowed absences. There is no \\nsuch thing as a free cut. \\n4. “Class meetings” refer to “contact hours,” which for onsite courses are spent on physical class \\nmeetings, while for online courses, on virtual class meetings. You are responsible for matters \\ntaken and assignments given during  your absence. \\n5. This course will depend a lot on group work and collaborative effort.  You are expected to \\nparticipate and weigh in.  Each group has a right to drop an uncooperative or delinquent \\nmember.  Again, please email me for difficulty with a group member, difficulty working with a \\ngroup, and other such things. \\n6. All requirements have to be submitted based on the deadline.  An automatic 10% deduction per \\nday will be applied to late submissions of tasks.  Submission of minor tasks and discussion \\nboards will close ten days after the published deadline, which means the task will be marked 0.  \\nSubmission of Major Tasks will always remain open, but please abide by the deadline. I do allow \\nsome leeway for acceptable reasons (illness, emergencies, unexpected bumps on the road).  If \\nthis adjustment is necessary, please contact me immediately so I can adjust your deadlines.  \\nAdjustments to deadlines will only be made for reasonable cause but please note that there are \\ntimes when no more adjustments are possible, so do avoid late submissions.  If anything comes \\nup that you think will interfere with your performance in this course, please inform me right away.  \\n7. The use of online tools and technology has become widespread, and in some cases, \\nacceptable. However, the use of Generative AI (GAI), such as ChatGPT, has raised serious \\nconcerns about what is appropriate and what is not. In this course, the limited use of  GAI may \\nbe allowed for certain tasks if permission from the teacher is obtained in advance and if the use \\nis properly documented and credited. Read the details on the approved uses of GAI . \\n8. Grades reflected on Canvas are not necessarily the official and final grades for the course. \\n9. All the course materials here were specially curated for the students of this course.  Do not \\nshare materials including videos, slideshows, and pages (in part or whole) with persons who do \\nnot belong to the class.  You may download course materials for your own use to fulfill the \\nrequirements of this course.  Taking screenshots or recording virtual meetings or text \\nchats/discussions for any purpose without the documented consent of all the participants is \\nstrictly prohibited.  When asking for consent, provide concerned parties with a copy of the image \\nor audio/video file you wish to use and indicate your purpose.  \\n10. We must ensure open and smooth two-way communication.  I always hope to answer your \\nemail in a timely fashion, in 24-48 hours at most.  Please be patient and email me again should I \\nfail to reply.  Communication should be coursed through University-issued (i.e., official) email \\naccounts: @obf.ateneo.edu accounts for students and @ateneo.edu accounts for faculty and \\nPC Syllabus SY 2023-2024 S2_mcbm \\n \\n8 \\n \\nprofessionals.  I hope to give feedback on submitted major outputs within a week or so after \\nsubmission. \\n11. I am just as anxious as you to make your learning here an enjoyable, relevant, and meaningful \\nexperience.  Our class is a safe space for everyone, including myself.  This means (1) keeping \\nthings private unless told otherwise (and that includes the course materials), (2) being patient \\nand respectful, (3) keeping lines of communication open, especially if something uncomfortable \\nhappens, (4) using fair, reasonable, and respectful means of settling disputes and problems and \\nnot ranting on any sort of platform, especially social media, (5) being kind and compassionate to \\neveryone.   \\nSCHOOL POLICIES  \\nWe must abide by university standards and codes of behavior.  \\n1. \\nPlease read the LS Undergraduate Student Handbook carefully.  Rules and regulations \\nstipulated in the handbook will be adhered to strictly, especially for plagiarism and acts of \\ndishonesty. \\n2. \\nThis class will adhere to the following: a)  Gender Policy  and b)  \\nCode of Decorum and Administrative Rules on Sexual Harassment, Other Forms of Sexual \\nMisconduct, and Inappropriate Behavior. \\n3. \\nOnly officially enrolled students may participate in classes (i.e., join groups, submit \\nrequirements, and take quizzes and assessments, etc.).  Officially enrolled students are \\nautomatically given access to Canvas. \\n4. \\nFor the protection of both instructors and students, there should be a third person from the class \\npresent during synchronous online consultations.  The instructor and the student should each \\ngive consent for the presence of this third person.  The consultations will be recorded. \\n5. \\nA recording of online synchronous classes will be uploaded in the class Google Drive or on \\nCanvas at least a day after the session.  The class beadle and co-beadle will please remind me \\nto record the session and upload the recording. \\n6. \\nA student beadle will be appointed.  The class beadle duties include: \\na. Create and manage alternative platforms for purposes of communication and community  \\nb. Serve as liaison between the class and the instructor \\nc. Remind the instructor to record synchronous class sessions \\nd. Report class concerns to the department chair and School Dean (e.g., deviations from the \\nsyllabus, difficulties in contacting the instructor, etc.) \\nIf you have any personal concerns that you believe will affect your performance in class, please \\ncommunicate this with the following offices: Office of Guidance and Counseling; ADAA;  your home \\ndepartment.  Here are also some offices you can contact should you require assistance: \\nOffice of Guidance & Counseling: Email: guidance.ls@ateneo.edu (or email your assigned counselor); 24/7 \\nHotline Numbers: 0920 918 2582 / 0920 946 6201 / 0920 859 8798 \\nOffice of Management Information Systems (OMIS): Email: omis.ls@ateneo.edu \\n \\nL.

    "socsci_text = '\\nSYLLABUS FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES\\nMAJOR, CORE CURRICULUM and ELECTIVES \\nA. COURSE INFORMATION\\nB. COURSE DESCRIPTION\\nThis course orients the student to an understanding of the self that functions and evolves within \\nreciprocal and dynamic interactions involving the developing individual and the persons, objects, \\nand systems in his or her environment. The self – with his or her biological, psychological, social \\nand cultural attributes and resources – is deeply embedded in social, cultural and historical \\nprocesses. The self is shaped by such processes in as much as the self reconfigures them. These \\nprocesses occur in contexts that vary from the proximal micro systems of family, peer, and other \\nclose relationships; to the macro systems of society, culture, and historical time. Students, thus, \\ndevelop a holistic understanding of the self.\\nThe course includes a self-care component, wherein students demonstrate personal self-awareness \\nand self-regulation, and reflexivity and self-acceptance, through informed ethical choices in \\naddressing conflicts, dilemmas, diversities, differences, and inequalities. \\nBinhi Program \\nThe Binhi Program is a formation program designed for first year students taking the SocSc 11: \\nUnderstanding the Self course and Introduction to Ateneo Culture and Traditions (InTACT). It is \\nhoped that through online kwentuhan, students are able to understand themselves deeper in \\nrelation to the connections shared with other people from different sectors and communities.\\nCOURSE NUMBER\\nSocSc11\\n NO.

Email: ls.one@ateneo.edu  Using the same email address, you may send GChat \\nmessages and chat with “OSSo” from 8:00am – 10:00pm on weekdays and 8:00am – 5:00pm on \\nSaturdays. \\n2/ Our first ONSITE Orientation : Friday 11th August 2023\\n3/ Online Individual consultations: For the protection of both instructors and students, there should \\nbe a third person present during a synchronous online consultation. The instructor and the \\nstudent should each give consent for the presence of this third person. If a consultation is to be \\nrecorded (instead of having a third person present), the recording must be downloaded, saved in \\nan ADMU GDRive account, and shared with the student unaltered. \\n4/ About Onsite + Asynchronous Learning: The integration of asynchronous learning with onsite \\nclasses allows a self-paced study plan within the boundaries of the time allotted for the course. \\nThis means that deadlines are part and parcel of all types of learning, including the Canvas online \\nversion. It is therefore crucial that each student makes a schedule of study and maintains personal \\ndiscipline to accomplish the learning goal.\\n5/ Instructor and Student Engagement: This course uses the student-centered approach to education \\nwhereby the instructor is a facilitator accompanying the self-learning practice of the student. This \\napproach allows students to practice critical thinking all through the course instead of memorizing and \\nrehashing the professor’s ideas. In other words, the responsibility for learning depends on the \\nstudent. The responsibility of the instructor is to facilitate the student’s learning through the design of \\nthe course and presence both onsite (face-to-face) and online (asynchronous). Instructors have \\ndedicated a lot of time to prepare the learning outcomes, to review content, to tailor content, and to \\nestablish strategies that enable students develop expected competencies. Instructors now journey \\nwith students in the learning process.\\n6/ Statement about adherence to the LS Gender Policy - Ateneo de Manila adopts the following \\nprinciples: 1/ Zero-Tolerance Policy against all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and \\ndiscrimination; 2/ Whole-of-University Approach in building a culture of respect for human dignity and \\nvigilance against all forms of abuse and discrimination; 3/ Do-No-Harm Principle in extending \\nassistance to persons who experience sexual harassment, other forms of sexual misconduct, and \\ninappropriate behavior; and 4/ Due Process in the conduct of administrative investigations.\\nWHERE IS THE COURSE SITUATED \\nWITHIN THE FORMATION STAGES \\nIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LOYOLA SCHOOLS CURRICULA\\n✓\\nFOUNDATIONS: Exploring and Equipping the Self\\nROOTEDNESS: Investigating and Knowing the World\\nDEEPENING: Defining the Self in the World\\nLEADERSHIP: Engaging and Transforming the World\\nC. *PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES\\n *This section does not apply to a student who is not a major of the program under which this course is \\nadministered\\n  Alignment of Program to the Core Curriculum Learning Outcomes\\nAlignment of the Course to the Program Learning Outcomes\\nD.

CLASS POLICIES\\nStandard Class Policies: \\n1/ Students abide by the Ateneo de Manila University’s standards for academic integrity. \\n2/ Students comply with course requirements within the semester via the Canvas learning \\nmanagement system. Please note the rules regarding completion should an INC be incurred by the \\nstudent.\\n3/ ATTENDANCE/ABSENCE. Students are allowed a maximum of 3 absences. Excusable absences \\nare not counted towards the maximum number of allowed absences. Please note the excusable \\nabsences and provide official documentation for them: physical illness (including Covid-19 in the \\nfamily), psycho-emotional and mental health concerns, family and other emergencies, internet \\nconnectivity issues, and student representation of university. Exceeding the allowed absence will merit \\na final grade of W. As university students, you are expected to take note of your own absences; the \\nteacher and formator will not remind you.\\nMoreover, a student must go through ALL Binhi program phases (i.e. Preparatory Session, Kwentuhan, \\nand Processing Session) to complete the Understanding the Self course. Because Binhi is the praxis \\ncomponent of SocSc11, students are expected to be present during the scheduled Binhi activities. If a \\nstudent incurs an absence, the student still needs to complete the Binhi activity that was missed.\\na.      Excused absence: The student gets credit/grade for the completed activity.\\nb.   Unexcused absence: The student will NOT get credit/grade for the completed activity, but still \\nneeds to complete the missed activity to get a grade in SocSc11.\\nFailure to complete the activities in these three phases, will merit an INC in Binhi, and thus an INC in \\nSocSc11.\\n4/ All correspondences must be made using official Ateneo email addresses.\\n5/ Consult the faculty and formator if you have concerns about the course.\\n6/ Consult LS One if you have general student concerns: www.ateneo.edu/lsone \\n7/ Consult the Office of Health Services for guidance on self-reporting of COVID-19 related \\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nillnesses: Mobile number: 0918-9445997   Email: healthservices.ls@ateneo.edu \\n \\n8/ Consult the Office of Guidance Counselling for guidance services: guidance.ls@ateneo.edu  \\n9/ For a general awareness of Ateneo\\'s code of decorum:  http://ateneo.edu/policies/code-decorum-\\t\\n\\t\\ninvestigation-sexual-harassment/faqs. \\n10/ For a general awareness of Ateneo\\'s gender policy: http://www.ateneo.edu/ls/ls-gender-policy \\nL.

CLASS POLICIES \\n1.\\nPrimary Mode. The fully onsite meeting is the primary mode of learning and teaching. The official \\nlearning management system for this course will still be Canvas for purposes of graded \\nasynchronous activities. Only students who are officially enrolled will be included in the Canvas class \\nand will be allowed to take assessments. \\n2.\\nCanvas Technical Requirements. Students are responsible for meeting the minimum technical \\nrequirements for using Canvas as it will still be used to manage course activities and assessments. \\nStudents with very unstable or no internet connection, or those requiring support for Canvas, are \\nadvised to immediately inform by email: (a) the Teacher, (b) ls.one@ateneo.edu, or (c) their Chair/ \\nProgram Director so that the appropriate university-prescribed measures and/or interventions can be \\nimplemented. Students can also chat with LS-One using their OBF email. \\n3.\\nCanvas Access. Student access to the Canvas course will be closed a week after the electronic \\nrelease of grades for the semester. Students may download the course materials as well as the \\nrecords of their grades before the Canvas course closes. \\n4.\\nFinal Grades. Scores reflected on Canvas, and the computations therein, are not necessarily the \\nonly basis for a student’s official grades for the class. Other grading components, as reflected in the \\nsyllabus, may not be viewed on Canvas.  \\n5.\\nTools for Understanding and Learning. Onsite or synchronous sessions and asynchronous \\nactivities whenever merited, including the learning or presentation handouts or materials that may be \\nprovided, are not meant to replace or substitute the primary and secondary sources on the subject, \\nbut will simply serve as tools to augment learning and understanding. As such, the students shall \\nremain personally and individually responsible in covering and studying the subject matter and topics, \\nbut always with proper guidance from the Teacher.  \\n6.\\nParticipation in Class Discussions. Class participation is an important component of a student's \\ngrade as it serves as a good gauge of the student's interest in the subject. Therefore, students are \\nstrongly encouraged to participate in class discussions or recitations, whether conducted onsite or \\nsynchronously online. Participation in class discussions is included in the computation of the final \\ngrade. \\n7.\\nAttendance. Regular attendance in all classes is one of the most important obligations of students \\n(2022 LS Undergraduate Academic Regulations Section III.1.2). Students are expected to attend and \\nfully participate in all class activities and sessions, both onsite and synchronous so that they enjoy \\nFinal Mark\\nNumerical Equivalent\\nQuality Point Equivalent \\nFor a 3-unit course\\nA\\n92 to 100\\n3.76 to 4.00\\nB+\\n87 to 91\\n3.31 to 3.75\\nB\\n83 to 86\\n2.81 to 3.30\\nC+\\n79 to 82\\n2.31 to 2.80\\nC\\n76 to 78\\n1.81 to 2.30\\nD\\n70 to 75\\n1.00 to 1.80\\nF\\nBelow 70\\nBelow 1.00\\nW\\nOvercut\\nOvercut\\nthe full benefits of learning. Accordingly, attendance will be checked every class session by the \\nTeacher, or by the class beadle, both for onsite and synchronous sessions.  \\nAs per Academic Regulations III.4.1: “There is no distinction between excused and unexcused \\nabsences.” \\nThe allowable number of absences for this subject is no more than 20% of the total number of \\nmeetings – onsite and synchronous class meetings – for the semester. For this class, you are \\nallowed a maximum of 2 absences. \\nAs per University policy, cuts/absences shall not be a factor against the grades of the student unless \\nthe student overcuts, which shall consequently merit a “W (Withdrawal)” under the university’s \\nacademic rules and regulations.     \\n8.\\nTardiness. Class attendance should not only be regular, but it should also be punctual. Recording \\nlateness as an absence has been left by the University to the instructor’s discretion under the 2022 \\nLS Undergraduate Academic Regulations Section III.3.  The teacher will accordingly determine and \\ncommunicate to the class his/her class policy as regards tardiness. \\n9.\\nTimely Submission of Assessments. All students are expected to keep up with the course \\nmaterials and submit assessments as required. Punctuality is required for the submission of \\nrequirements that are subject to deadlines. As such, the Teacher reserves the academic right and \\ndiscretion to impose the appropriate penalty deductions for any late submission of graded \\nrequirements.   \\n10. Class Materials and Recordings. Class lectures conducted during online synchronous sessions (if \\nany) may be recorded for reference purposes. A recording of the online synchronous session will be \\nuploaded to a cloud drive (Google Drive or OneDrive) after the synchronous session.  Class materials \\nand recordings of synchronous sessions may not be reproduced, shared, or reposted by students \\nwithout the express written consent of the Teacher. \\n11. Use of Electronic Gadgets and/or Devices. During class sessions, unless allowed by the Teacher, \\nstudents are prohibited from using electronic gadgets and/or devices except if the same is necessary \\nto complete a graded activity or assessment exercise. All electronic gadgets and/or devices not \\nneeded during the class should be turned off.  Should it be urgently necessary for a student to \\nsend a message or answer a call, he/she should step out of the classroom as discreetly as possible, \\nso as not to disturb the rest of the class.  The Teacher reserves the right to provide an appropriate \\npenalty for any violation of this policy (discretion of the teacher). \\n12. Responsible Use of Personal Data and Social Media. Personal data collected for class or any \\nother official activity must not be used for any personal benefit. Students should be mindful in posting \\nor sharing on their personal social media accounts any media involving the class or any of its \\nmembers, including the Teacher, which must be taken down when prompted and asked to do so. \\nPosting or sharing, whenever not objected to, should never be done for any unethical or unlawful \\npurpose.  All materials with personal information, sensitive or otherwise, are subject to the provisions \\nof the Data Privacy Act.   \\n13. Intellectual Honesty and Academic Integrity.  Students are required to uphold intellectual honesty \\nand academic integrity in all class requirements and activities, as well as adhere to the Loyola \\nSchools Undergraduate Student Handbook. \\na.\\nCheating or any form of intellectual dishonesty will not be tolerated. Cheating in any requirement \\nwill result in a failing mark and be subject to disciplinary proceedings as provided for by the \\nStudent Code of Conduct. \\nb.\\nEach piece of assessable work must demonstrably be the student/s’ own. Unauthorized copying, \\nborrowing, or the unacknowledged use of another person’s ideas or written language as one’s \\nown whether published or unpublished will be penalized. Any piece of work that is plagiarized in \\nwhole or in part will not be assessed and will be marked with a failing mark.  Should that \\nparticular requirement constitute more than 20% of the final grade, the failing mark will result in \\nthe student failing the whole course. \\nc.\\nFor group work, the members are expected to review the final paper before submission to ensure \\nthat violations have not been incurred. This includes the need to use quotation marks for verbatim \\nstatements lifted from another work and to cite all sources in research work through footnotes \\nand/or bibliographies. \\nd.\\nAnother problem with respect to academic integrity is collusion. Collusion is working together in \\nanswering quizzes or individual assignments/exercises in ways not authorized by the Teacher. \\nThis shall likewise be subject to disciplinary action. \\n14. Use of Artificial Intelligence.  Pending the issuance of the university guidelines and protocol in the \\nuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in academic requirements, it is still fundamental that any written work, \\npaper submission, or oral presentation must be the product of the student’s own effort, diligence, \\nthinking, and reflection. Thus, students are expected to uphold the responsible and ethical use of \\nexternal and/or artificial aid (e.g. apps, editors, or AI in all its forms) in any graded written and/or \\noral requirement.  Students are likewise expected to disclose the use of AI, and to attribute its use \\naccordingly, to preserve the integrity of the academic exercise. \\n15. Additional Policies. Additional policies to adapt to the class environment may be implemented by \\nthe Teacher after due consultation and agreement with the students. Students are advised to be \\ncognizant of such updates. \\n16. Communications Protocol.  For any question, clarification, or concern regarding the subject matter, \\nthe students may contact the Teacher through his/her official Ateneo email address indicated or via \\nCanvas messaging during work hours (8:00 AM-6:00 PM). Given that the Teacher is not on-call/\\nonline all the time and maybe attending to other academic, professional, and personal \\nresponsibilities, response or feedback on the queries will be given through Canvas or email no later \\nthan one (1) to two (2) days from receipt thereof. Communications should be coursed through \\nUniversity-issued (i.e., official) email accounts: @obf.ateneo.edu accounts for students and \\n@ateneo.edu accounts for faculty. \\n17. Consultation Hours. Students are encouraged to use the consultation hours as an opportunity for \\ndiscussion about the content and requirements of the course, as well as to inquire about their \\nacademic standing. Consultation hours are also used to solicit or give feedback on performance in \\nassessments.  This is also a venue for the students to inform the Teacher if there are any current or \\nemergent circumstances that make learning difficult. \\nConsultation hours will be announced individually by the Teacher. The students are encouraged to \\nregularly seek the advice of their respective Faculty. You may check their availability with the \\nSecretary (Ms. Ghing Lopez) of the Leadership and Strategy Department. You may also email them \\ndirectly to request an appointment. \\n18. Student Handbook. The Loyola Schools Undergraduate Student Handbook (2022 Edition) will serve \\nas a guide for all class policies.  The policies issued by the Loyola Schools and/or the University shall \\nform part of and are deemed incorporated in the class policies. Individual faculty may issue additional \\nguidelines for their respective classes. \\n19. Gender Inclusivity and Safe Spaces.  We want a safe and inclusive environment for all members \\nof the Ateneo de Manila community.  Our goal is to build a culture of trust, respect, and inclusivity \\nwithin our community.  As such, the Teacher and the Department strongly support and strictly adhere \\nto the Loyola Schools Policy Statement for a Gender-Inclusive, Gender-Responsive, and Gender-\\nSafe Community.  Accordingly, please also be informed and guided by the Ateneo de Manila \\nNAME OF FACULTY\\nEMAIL\\nDAY/S\\nTIME\\nJyro B.

CLASS POLICIES \\n1. The official learning management system for this course will be Canvas.   Only students who are \\nofficially enrolled will be included in the Canvas class and will be allowed to take and submit graded \\nassessments.  \\n2. Attendance will be checked.  As per the updated academic policies released by the Assistant Vice \\nPresident for Undergraduate Education, students will receive the grade of W if the total number of \\nabsences in a class exceeds 20% of the total number of meetings during the term.   \\n3. Students who arrive 15 minutes or more after the start time will incur 1 cut.  Those who arrive within \\nthe first 15 minutes are given half a cut. \\n4. No extra work will be given to students who want to improve their grades.  The course requirements \\nalready provide ample opportunity for students to get good grades. \\n5. Make-up long tests may be given in the case of grave medical and familial reasons (e.g., debilitating \\nillness, death in the family) or official representation of the school (e.g., athletic events and other \\ncompetitions, as endorsed by the appropriate Ateneo office), after the submission of relevant \\ndocuments as proof.  Commitments to attend events like weddings and birthdays, and to \\ntravel are not considered valid reasons to secure a make-up exam. \\n6. Use A4 bond paper in all long tests.  Erasable pens are not allowed.  Only non-metallic black or \\nblue ink is allowed. \\n7. Late submission of graded requirements will incur deductions.  Penalties (e.g., a zero in that graded \\nrequirement) will solely be at the discretion of the teacher. \\n8. Penalties will be imposed on submissions that are either completed after the deadline or not \\ncompliant to the guidelines set by the teacher. \\n9. You are expected to have all the learning tools you need for this course. No borrowing and/or \\nlending of calculators, especially during exams. Furthermore, cellular phones may not be used as \\ncalculators. \\n10. Requests for a recheck of any grade work should be made within two days after it is returned. Any \\nrequests made after that will not be entertained.  \\n11. Cellular phones and other electronic devices should either be switched off or placed in silent mode \\nduring class hours. \\n12. The teacher reserves the right to send anyone out of the classroom on the grounds of discourtesy to \\nthe teacher or to a fellow student, of misbehavior in the classroom, and of other reasons as \\nprovided by the student handbook. \\n13. Students are expected to exercise the highest level of academic integrity. Students are expected to \\ntreat their classmates and instructor with respect. Cheating, plagiarism, discourtesy or misbehavior \\nwhich includes, but is not limited to, posting of answers, hints, or any useful information to any \\ngraded work in any platform will not be tolerated and will be treated in accordance to the Student \\nHandbook. \\n14. Ateneo de Manila University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, marital or parental \\nstatus, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.
